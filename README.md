# Finance-Focused Quant Development Projects

## About Me

Driven and analytical, I am a Mechatronics Engineering graduate with a Master's in Finance, aspiring to transition into a Quant Developer role within a leading investment bank. My background provides a strong foundation in both technical problem-solving and financial theory.

During my free time, I actively enhance my coding skills, primarily in Python, with a specific focus on developing applications relevant to finance. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex financial challenges and am eager to contribute to a dynamic quantitative team.

## Current Projects

### Machine Learning for Sentiment & Alpha Signal Detection

This project involves building a Python program to explore the intersection of natural language processing, machine learning, and financial markets. The goal is to:

* **Analyse news sentiment:** Utilise machine learning techniques to extract and quantify sentiment from financial news sources (initially exploring free APIS).
* **Identify potential alpha signals:** Develop and backtest quantitative trading signals derived from traditional financial data and sentiment analysis.
* **Visualise findings:** Present the sentiment trends, alpha signals, and potential trading strategies through clear and informative visualisations.

**Key Technologies:** Python, Machine Learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, potentially others), Free Finance APIs (e.g., yfinance), Data visualisation libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn).

### C++ for High-Performance Finance Applications (Future Work)

I am also in the initial stages of exploring C++ to develop similar finance-related applications with a focus on performance and efficiency. This will involve:

* Learning core C++ concepts and best practices.
* Investigating suitable C++ libraries for numerical computation and financial data handling.
* Potentially port some Python-based strategies to C++ for enhanced speed and deployment capabilities.

## Skills

* **Programming Languages:** Python (learning), C++ (learning)
* **Machine Learning:** Regression, Classification, Time Series Analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP) fundamentals
* **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Engineering:** Mechatronics Systems, Control Systems, Signal Processing, Numerical Methods


## Aspirations

My goal is to apply my interdisciplinary skillset in a challenging and rewarding Quant Developer position at an investment bank. I am keen to contribute to the development of sophisticated trading algorithms, risk management systems, and other quantitative finance solutions. I am a fast learner, highly motivated, and eager to collaborate within a team of experienced professionals.
